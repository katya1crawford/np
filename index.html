                    Anna Vadimovna Sorokina, (Russian: Анна Вадимовна Сорокина;[1] born January 23, 1991)[4] also known as Anna Sorokin, is a Russian-born fraudster.
                    She moved
                    to
                    New York City in 2013 and created the fictitious identity of Anna Delvey, pretending to be a wealthy German heiress. In 2019, she was convicted
                    of multiple
                    counts of attempted grand larceny, theft of services, and larceny in the second degree for defrauding New York hotels and wealthy acquaintances.

                    Sorokina's story was widely reported on for her ability to blend into social circles and as of 2019, television adaptions of her story are in
                    development
                    at
                    Netflix and HBO.
